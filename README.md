# PeggTriageGradebook
JR Pegg's Triage Gradebook Project

Proof of concept / UX testing for triage grade-scale grading program.
The purpose of this project is to find a "less stressful" alternative to a traditional gradebook when used in conjunction with a triage grading system, as seeing values such as 2/3 or even 1/3 causes the student to interpret the grade as a straight fractional ratio, causing panic even in those who understand the grade scale.

Developed using JavaFX Scene Builder and IntelliJ IDEA.
